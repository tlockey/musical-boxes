This project is based on the events tracker exercise in the Launch School JS 230 > Events and Asynchronous Programming Exercises Set.
This project records events, and then, when the user wishes, it plays it back to them. 
The visual aspect was designed in Figma. I then used HTML and CSS Flexbox to bring it to life.
The tones are from Tone.js.
